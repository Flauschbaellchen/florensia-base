desc=Adventurer, would you spare me just a little of your time? Some time ago, there was a man studying magic in the Holy Union. He maybe made a mistake while he was practicing magical spells.Recently, he was cursed so he keeps having nightmares every single night. This is the first time something like that happened and he couldn't find a way how to solve his problem. He barely slept because of the nightmare. The nightmare is so terrible, so just a few minutes after he falls asleep, he keeps waking up and screaming every night.

We set a bonfire alight by his side to keep the nightmare away. We gave him enough firewood, because we didn't know when we could solve his problem. However, monsters stole all the firewood while he was sleeping. Those monsters ran away to each island and we now need brave adventurers to get the firewood back. Please retrieve the firewood for us!

desc=Adventurer, would you spare me just a little of your time? Some time ago, there was a man studying magic in the Holy Union. He maybe made a mistake while he was practicing magical spells.Recently, he was cursed so he keeps having nightmares every single night. This is the first time something like that happened and he couldn't find a way how to solve his problem. He barely slept because of the nightmare. The nightmare is so terrible, so just a few minutes after he falls asleep, he keeps waking up and screaming every night.

We set a bonfire alight by his side to keep the nightmare away. We gave him enough firewood, because we didn't know when we could solve his problem. However, monsters stole all the firewood while he was sleeping. Those monsters ran away to each island and we now need brave adventurers to get the firewood back. Please retrieve the firewood for us!
