# Florensia-Base

Florensia-Base (nicknamed FloBase) was a one-man, private, non-profit fanpage about the MMORPG 'Florensia'.

Thanks to all those translators, donators and players who helped Florensia-Base to stay alive and always up-to-date over so many years.

This repository holds all scripts used to run FloBase, but most notably the update script to keep FloBase always in sync with the game itself.
The script can be found within `working/autoupdate.rb`.

Be prepared - the code is horrible, messy and no CMS or any other kind of eyecandy/helpers were used.
So, please, do not use it to setup your own page. It's most likely to be exploited.
There is no further documentation - it was hard to write so it needs to be hard to read ;)

In 2014 an attempt was made to rework the whole page (migrate from php to ruby/rails) and update-procedure.
It can be found here: https://github.com/Flauschbaellchen/gaming-base
However, it was never finished (`working/autoupdate.to-be-migrated.rb`) but can be used as a start for further developments.
It's way better, faster and cleaner than the "old" update script.
